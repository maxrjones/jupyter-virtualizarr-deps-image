# Curated Docker Image for repo2docker

This repository contains a curated Docker container based on jupyter/base-notebook. It contains VirtualiZarr's dependencies for development on a JupyterHub environment. VirtualiZarr itself is not installed, so that it can be editable installed using a repository already cloned to the shared filesystem.
